# How this algorithm works is pretty simple (its not an algorithm though ðŸ˜…)

#     github progress bar has 7 rows and 52 columns (thus is represents 365 days)

# 1. it takes the text and try to create an image of 7x52 size
# 2. then for every pixel in the numpy array of the image, it checks for the pixel that has color (it means the r+g+b value must be greater than 0)
# 3. then it stores those coordinates in the coords array

#     coords array stores coord -> consists of 3 elements
#         1st element is the column number
#         2nd element is the row  number
#         3rd element is the brightless
#                 github progress data-level has 5 level of brightness - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
#                     thus is only takes the non-zero pixel, so the brightness can be represented as (total rgb value / 191)
#                                 --> this 191 comes from here: 
#                                             255 + 255 + 255 = 765
#                                             765 // 4 = 191 [as 4 level of actual brightless, 0 is for zero-progress, so we dont need that as we deal with only the colored pixel]
                                        
#     then it returns the coords
